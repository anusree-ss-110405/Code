IF - ELSE IF - ELSE:
->  We can refactor the code, we can remove the lower bounds and check only the upper bounds 
    for each grade as the code flow is such that we move along the conditions only after satisfying 
    the previous one.
->  if-else statements and their variants empower you to write code that responds dynamically 
    to changing conditions.
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
SWITCH:
->  The break statement is crucial; 
    it ensures that the switch statement exits after the matching case is executed, 
    preventing the execution of subsequent cases.
->  The (Optional) Default Case: The default case serves as a safety net. If none of the cases match the expression, 
    the code inside the default block will execute.
->  Requirement for a Constant Expression
    A switch statement necessitates that its expression results in a constant value. 
    This can include constants and arithmetic operations.
->  Limited to Integer or Character Types
    Switch statements are exclusively designed to handle integer or character values. 
    Ensure that the expression provides values of type int or char.
->  Prohibition of Duplicate Case Values
    Within a switch statement in C++, duplicates of case values are disallowed. 
    Each case value must be distinct.
->  Potential for Nested Switch Statements
    While it's possible to nest one switch statement inside another in C++, 
    this practice is generally discouraged due to its potential to introduce complexity and hinder code readability.
->  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 2;
        int y = 3;

        switch (x) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("x is 1.");
                switch (y) {
                    case 1:
                        System.out.println("y is 1.");
                        break;
                    default:
                        System.out.println("y is not 1.");
                }
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("x is not 1.");
        }
    }
}

What is a For Loop and Why is it Used?
    A for loop is a control structure in programming that allows you to execute a specific block of code repeatedly. 
    It's especially useful when you want to perform the same task multiple times without duplicating your code. 
    ->  Initialization: You declare and initialize a variable that serves as a counter. 
        This step only happens once at the beginning.
    ->  Condition: You specify a condition that determines when the loop should stop executing.
    ->  Increment/Decrement: You define how the counter variable changes after each iteration.
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
While Loop:
    ->  While loops are particularly useful when you need to ensure that a block of code executes only when the condition is satisfied 
        as it terminates as soon as that condition becomes false.
    -> Without proper termination conditions, a while loop can run indefinitely, leading to what's known as an "infinite loop." 
        Infinite loops can crash programs and consume excessive system resources, making them a critical issue to avoid.
    ->  break: It allows you to exit the loop prematurely, even before the termination condition is met.
    ->  continue: It skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next one.
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
Pass-by-reference: When a method is called, the method arguments reference the same variable in memory as the caller.
Pass-by-value: When a method is called, the caller passes a copy of the argument variables to the method resulting in two values in memory.
